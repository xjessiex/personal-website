# Personal Website [Powered by Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)

#### Project Status: [In Progress]

## Project Intro
> Minimal Mistakes is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme, perfect for building personal sites, blogs, and portfolios. As the name implies, styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you :smile:.

I chose to make this website using this Gem-based method because it's easier to edit and preview the website in real time. Here is the instruction from the theme creater:

### Gem-based method
With Gem-based themes, directories such as the `assets`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, and `_sass` are stored in the theme’s gem, hidden from your immediate view. Yet all of the necessary directories will be read and processed during Jekyll’s build process.

This allows for easier installation and updating as you don't have to manage any of the theme files. To install:

1. Add the following to your `Gemfile`:

   ```ruby
   gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"
   ```

2. Fetch and update bundled gems by running the following [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) command:

   ```bash
   bundle
   ```

3. Set the `theme` in your project's Jekyll `_config.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   theme: minimal-mistakes-jekyll
   ```

To update the theme run `bundle update`.

### Tools
* Ruby version 2.5.5
* Jekyll version 3.8.5

### Featured Deliverables
Website is deployed on [Netlify](https://zen-wozniak-792695.netlify.com/).
