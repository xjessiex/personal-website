## Introduction to Utility Business Models
In one of my seminars at Duke, I was learning the history and transformation of the U.S. power sector -- I was lucky enough to have James Roger from Duke Energy as one of the instructors, shortly before he passed away last winter. While the power sector has multiple players in the field, such as the federal goverment and public utility commissions, utilities have stood out as one of the largest influencers, since the establishment of Public Utility Holding Company Act. Utilites are natural monopolies and their business models are mostly a reaction to policies and bills. Through regualtions, Policymakers have to balance between investor-owned utilites (IOUs) and consumers who use the generated power. 

In my class, the instructors summarized the emergence of the utilities and wholesale market structure as a "big bang". And for the past thirty years, we have seen the flaws of the current utility business model due to the fast-developed regulatory structure. The incentives of those utilities have become the biggest issue. Due to a guaranteed rate of return on infrastructure investments, utilities are incentivized to build more transmission infrastructure. As we approach an era of distrubuted energy resources with minimal long-range transmission, utilities are disincentivized to support clean local energy to protect its revenue.  

## What about Wildfires?
Everyone would rememebr the 2018 wildfire that led to the bankruptcy of Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), California's largest utility. And the cause of the sparking wildfire comes exactly from the costly transmission infrastructure. Here is a great podcast episode that describes an in-depth stories of the wildfire investigation. Even though in January 2019, PG&E unfortunately had to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, this wildfire incident might be a chance to reconstruct PG&E and prepare it for the future distributed systems.
