For this project, I ended up using Gem-based method and deployed my website through [Netlify](sss) for free. This let me make more adjustment to the home page, such as creating a head image and overlay text. If you also choose Gem-based method, you might not be able to deploy your website through Github Page. Another problem I had was enabling the Facebook comment option. I had to manuelly add HTML lines in each post to enable the comments. I did not see similar problems in other people's websites.
