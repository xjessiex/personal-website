As an international student, I've always had a hard time finding jobs and internships due to my visa status. Thus, this post is dedicated to sharing the career resources I use. You may find this post particularly helpful if you are an international student or young professional who is looking for energy-related jobs. This post can also be helpful for recruiters who are considering hiring an international student or intern.

## But first, what is an OPT?
Optional Practical Training (OPT) allows international students to work in their major area of study for 12 months in total during or after academic programs. This visa option help international students remain in the U.S. to gain work exerience relevant to their degree studies. For any F-1 student who receives a STEM degree (like my Master of Science degree), there is a 24-month extension available, in addition to the 12-month post-completion OPT employment. 

## From OPT to H1B
The most unspoken rule about looking for a job as an international student with OPT is to land on a job with sponsorship for H1B visa. 

H1B status grants up to six years of employment with extension and can be potentially transitioned to a green card.

## Internship
For internship, however, hiring an international student would be the same as hiring a domestic one - there is no financial burden on the company. For more information, I encourage you to check out the [Frequently Asked Questions section]( https://visaservices.duke.edu/categories/f1/opt) published by Duke Visa Service. Please take a closer look at the listed questions:
- Question #16 - paid vs. unpaid internships
- Question #18, #20 - unemployment period
- Question #27 - extension for STEM majors

## Helpful websites
To evaluate if a company sponsors international students, please check the [H-1B Emplyer Data Hub](https://www.uscis.gov/h-1b-data-hub). It can save you time and pick the right target companies to apply to.

For recent graduates, this [Dayaway website](https://www.dayawaycareers.com/entry-level-renewable-energy-jobs-search/) provides a list of energy job listings based on your degrees and majors.

In this section, I want to recommend some companies and organizations that I've interacted with or applied to.
