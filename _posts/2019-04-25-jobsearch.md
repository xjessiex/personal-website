As an international student, I've always had a hard time finding jobs and internships due to my visa status. Thus, this post is dedicated to sharing the career resources I use. You may find this post particularly helpful if you are an international student or young professional who is looking for energy-related jobs. This post can also be helpful for recruiters who are considering hiring an international student or intern.

## But first, what is an OPT?
The most unspoken rule about looking for a job as an international student is to look for one with sponsorship. For internship, it is more lenient - there is no financial burden on the company. For more information, I encourage you to check out the [Frequently Asked Questions section]( https://visaservices.duke.edu/categories/f1/opt) published by Duke Visa Service. Please take a closer look at the listed questions:
- Question #16 - paid vs. unpaid internships
- Question #18, #20 - unemployment period
- Question #27 - extension for STEM majors
